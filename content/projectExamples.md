### STArFLOW

### SDSS Stellar Ages Working Group

### SDSS-V Pipeline: 
I help with the development and maintance of the data pipelines for the 5th iteration of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I insepct the data as it comes down from the observatories and identify any issues in the data, such as low throughputs, poor guiding, etc. I also examine the reduced data products to help identify any issues with the reduction pipelines for the BOSS and APOGEE instruments
